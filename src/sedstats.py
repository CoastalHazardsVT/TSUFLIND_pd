# =============================================function sedstats===========================================
# This function is designed to compute moment measures and Folk and Ward statistics from sediment grain size
# weight % and phi size classes.
# Inputs: phi:grain size (phi) for each size class
#        weight:weight (or weight percent, vol concentration) for size classes
# Calculated: phimdpt:phi midpoints used for moment measures for tsunami samples, [-1.125:.25:10 12]
# Outputs:    m1:mean grain size (phi), 1st moment
#            stdev:standard deviation (phi) similar to sorting, is equal to square root of 2nd moment
#            m3:third moment
#            m4:fourth moment
#            fwmedian:Folk and Ward medium grain size (phi), 50th percentile
#            fwmean:Folk and Ward mean grain size (phi)
#            fwsort:Folk and Ward sorting (phi)
#            fwskew:Folk and Ward skewness
#            fwkurt:Folk and Ward Kurtosis
